An approach for the edge detection is presented using the fuzzy logic, and the evolutionary learning techniques such as bacterial foraging, particle swarm optimization, genetic algorithm and gravitational search algorithms. Detection of edge pixels in color images by fuzzy detectors is the main focus of this paper. In this approach a circular mask is applied separately on R, G, B components of RGB color space to compute USAN area about every pixel in the image leading to the USAN area image. Histogram based Gaussian membership function is used to detect the strong edges and the modified bell -shaped function is used to detect the weak edges from this image after fuzzification. Entropy and edge sharpness factor involved in the objective function and the parameters that control the shape and the range of the modified bell -shaped function are optimized using different evolutionary techniques. The edge maps of the three color components are obtained by subjecting the fuzzified USAN area images of color components to the adaptive thresholding. The final edge map is obtained by combining the edge maps of the above three color components. Experimental results show that this approach is less sensitive to noise without causing edge displacement. Visual and quantitative analysis demonstrates that the proposed method is better than the traditional edge detectors available in the literature.
